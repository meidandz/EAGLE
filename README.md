**EAGLE** is a three-stage alignment framework designed to enhance Large Vision-Language Models (LVLMs) in pathology by leveraging expert-guided self-enhancement and preference data.

---

## üîç Overview

### 1. Supervised Fine-Tuning (SFT)
- Fine-tune a base LVLM (e.g., Vicuna + QuiltNet) using pathology-specific instruction data.

### 2. Self-Preference Creation
Generate preference data **without human annotation**, through:
- **Chosen Sampling**: Prompted outputs guided by expert knowledge.
- **Rejected Sampling**: Created by controlled corruptions, including:
  - **Entity Replacement**: Using medical Named Entity Recognition (NER).
  - **Visual Masking**: Deliberate mislocalization or occlusion of critical image regions.

### 3. Preference-Following Tuning (PFT)
- Apply **Direct Preference Optimization (DPO)** to:
  - Reward preferred (chosen) outputs.
  - Penalize corrupted (rejected) outputs.
- Support **multi-round tuning** for iterative refinement.

---

## üí° Key Contributions
- Introduces a **scalable, expert-guided self-enhancement** pipeline.
- Builds **pathology-specific preference pairs** with minimal human cost.
- Improves **faithfulness, factual accuracy, and localization ability** in pathology VQA tasks.
